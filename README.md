Sibil
=====

A Scheme interpreter.

## TODO

A whole ton of stuff. Very much a work in progress. And this list is by no means
exhaustive, though I will continue to add to it as I think of things...

### `sibil` -- The actual binary

- [ ] Environments
- [ ] REPL
- [ ] Standard library stuff

### `sibillexer` -- The lexer

- [ ] Rational numbers
- [ ] Complex numbers
- [ ] Quasiquotes (this is not context free apparently, so I expect Badness)
- [ ] Proper error handling

### `sibilparser` -- The parser

- [ ] Programs
- [ ] SExpressions: Atoms
- [ ] SExpressions: Lists
- [ ] Proper error handling

### `sibiltypes` -- The type library

- [ ] Complex numbers
- [ ] Addition of disparate types of numbers
- [ ] Subtraction of numbers
- [ ] Multiplication of numbers
- [ ] Division of numbers
